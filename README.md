# Project Catalyst Overview

Note: This document is a work in progress. If you find yourself here and have suggestions for how to improve it or questions contact me on twitter [@dwesty17](https://twitter.com/dwesty17) or by email at j.dylan.westerhold@gmail.com. I'll do my best to get back to you.

Reading Time: **2-4 minutes**

The Project Catalyst organization is a collection of lessons that **are intended** to enable someone without prior coding knowledge to start quickly doing software development. They **are not intended** to be in-depth. Rather, it's supposed to give you the absolute basics that you need to develop software locally and push it to a remote repository.

I'll do my best when it seems appropriate to link to more detailed content for thos einterested in learning more about a particular topic. Unless otherwise noted reading any links are not neccassary to complete the lessons.

The first few lessons are focused on the software that all developers use, and they are mostly language and framework agnostic. After learning the most basic tooling we'll explore the basics of JavaScript and then the React framework for UI development. For the time being the lessons assume you are working on Mac.

## A Quick Note (optional)

These lessons skip countless numbers of valuable topics. I hear frequently from people who want to begin writing code, but are faced with a steep learning curve or are overwhelmed with too much information before they can create anything. That serves as teh motivation to keep these lessons as lightweight as possible. 

Additionally, creating software is a hobby or career where you'll always be learning. One of the most important skills you can develop is learning how write well crafted Google searches - how to describe your problem. Hopefully by getting developers will be more engaged with the topics they need to learn after they have developed the basic enough skills to apply those lessons.
