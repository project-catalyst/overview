Note: This document is a work in progress. If you find yourself here and have suggestions for how to improve it or questions contact me on twitter [@dwesty17](https://twitter.com/dwesty17) or by email at j.dylan.westerhold@gmail.com. I'll do my best to get back to you.

Reading Time: **2-4 minutes**

The Project Catalyst organization is a collection of lessons that **are intended** to enable someone without prior coding knowledge to start quickly doing software development. They **are not intended** to be in-depth. Rather, it's supposed to give you the absolute basics that you need to develop software locally and push it to a remote repository.

I'll do my best when it seems appropriate to link to more detailed content for anyone who's curious about a particular topic. Unless otherwise noted reading any links are not neccassary to complete the lessons.

The first few lessons are focused on the software that all developers use, and they are mostly language and framework agnostic. After learning the most basic tooling we'll explore the basics of JavaScript and then the React framework for UI development. For the time being the lessons assume you are working on Mac.
