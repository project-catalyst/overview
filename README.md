Reading Time: 2-4 minutes

The Project Catalyst organization is a collection of lessons that **are intended** to enable someone without prior coding knowledge to do software development. They **are not intended** to be in-depth, rather it's supposed to give you the absolute basics that you need to develop software locally and push it to a remote repository. 

I'll do my best when it seems appropriate to link to more detailed content for anyone who's curious about a particular topic. Unless otherwise noted reading any links are not neccassary to complete these lessons.

The first few lessons are focused on the software that all developers use, and they are mostly agnostic to any languages or frameworks. After learning the basics we'll explore the basics of JavaScript and then the React framework for UI development. For the time being the lessons assume you are working on
